# Project report 


The following sections are required. Your report is supposed to demonstrate a certain set of knowledge, skills and behaviours. These are listed alongside the relevant questions as quotes.

## Introduction 
* What are you building?
    - web app that user can search movie and filter saved movie
* Why are you building it?
    - Practice React components.
    
## Project scope 
* What are you not building?
    - database and user authentication feature.
* How did you decide what features were important?
    - use react state and effect to make web app responsive rigth away with what user add or change.
    
## Project plan 
* How are you going to structure your sprints?
    - exchange random ideas that has relation with criteria.
* What order are you going to build in?
    - define user, design features, build features and combine the feature in the app.
* How did user research inform your plan?

## Requirement analysis 
* How will you ensure your project is accessible to as many users as possible?
    - use light house to check accessibility.
* Are there any legal or regulatory requirements you should consider?
    - the right of use poster image.

## Project learnings 
* Did your team work effectively?
    - work in remote completely, it happened asynchronously.
* What would you do differently next time?
    - use figma design app.
    
## Research and findings 
* What did you find out from user testing?

## Project outcomes 
* Were your assumptions right or wrong?

## Recommendations and conclusions 
* What features would you prioritise to build next?
    - search function's error handling.
* Was the project a success?
    - every feature works, error handling is not applied.

## Software Development Lifecycle stages 

### Planning 
* What roles did your team take on?
    - mixed for this project as only 2 people work.
* Explain the roles and responsibilities of all people working within the software development lifecycle, and how they relate to the project (K2)
    
* Did these roles help your team work effectively?
    
* Outline how teams work effectively to produce software and how to contribute appropriately (K6) 
    
* Compare and contrast the requirements of a software development team, and how they would ensure that each member (including themselves) were able to make a contribution (K6)
    

### Analysis 
* What might be the intended and unintended consequences of building this product?
    - movie data api brought unexpected movie at first.

### Design 
* How did you plan a user experience?
    - user typed movie title and save movies in their menu
    - user can filter the movies with release year.
    - user can filter the movies with categories.
    
* What technical decisions did you make?
    * Server-render vs client-render vs both : client-render
    * Relational or non-relational or no DB : no DB
    * Self-hosted or platform-as-a-service : platform-as-a-service
    * Frontend first vs DB first : frontend first

* Did you create a technical specification?


* Review methods of software design with reference to functional/technical specifications and apply a justified approach to software development (K11, S11, S12)
    

### Implementation/Build 
* How did you ensure your code was good?
* Create logical and maintainable code to deliver project outcomes, explaining their choice of approach. (S1)

* What interesting technical problems did you have to solve?
* Outline and apply the rationale and use of algorithms, logic and data structures. (K9, S16)

* How did you debug issues that arose?
* Apply structured techniques to problem solving to identify and resolve issues and debug basic flaws in code (S7)

### Test 
* How did you verify your project worked correctly?
* Identify and create test scenarios which satisfy the project specification (S6)

* Did writing automated tests catch any bugs?
* Analyse unit testing results and review the outcomes, correcting errors. (S4)

### Deploy 
* Where/how did you deploy your application?
* Review and justify their contribution to building, managing and deploying code into the relevant environment in accordance with the project specification (S10)

* What problems did you encounter during deployment?

### Maintain 
* Is it easy for someone make changes to the codebase?
* Could a new person quickly be onboarded to contribute?
* Establishes a logical thinking approach to areas of work which require valid reasoning and/or justified decision making (B2)
* Describes how they have maintained a productive, professional and secure working environment throughout the project activity (B3)
